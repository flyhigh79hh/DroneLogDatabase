# DroneLogger

Hi!
This is my "Drone Logger App", lazy created with lots of google GEMINI assistance.

For detailed setup and running instructions, please refer to [GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md).

The app is made to import EdgeTX-CSV-Log files from your remote and DJI CSV Log files from the Fly DJI App that have been decoded. (Info how to do this will be added here later, meanwhile google will help)
The drones I use it with have all Betaflight-FCs and EdgeTX or are DJI Drones (Avata2, Neo and Mini4k tested)

Always keep the full backup zips after you make bigger changes to your database.

USE AT OWN RISK!
